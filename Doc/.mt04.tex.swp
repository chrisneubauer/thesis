\label{Naive Bayes on accounting records}

An invoice always contains one or more positions. Those positions are the reasons why the invoice even exist. But, depending on the company, those positions can be accounted in different ways. While one company would use only two accounts, another company could split the corresponding value on one side into two (or more) accounts.
This behavior is dependent on the position. But same positions are accounted the same way. Therefore, we want a machine learning approach that is flexible enough to address this issue depending on the way a position has been booked before, but is also able to learn and to correctly classify a position.
