\section{Task}

The task of this master thesis is to evaluate different electronic invoice formats. 
An application shall be designed and implemented that processes invoice forms and is capable of storing them in the invoice format that suits the most.
The application should use machine learning in order to improve processing accuracy over time.
Nevertheless, errors during the scan process should be handled by the application itself.

The output of this application should be conform with the definition of the electronic invoice format that has been decided in beforehand.
